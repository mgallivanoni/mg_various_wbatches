various batches to help users live with windows

1. **force-laptop-sleep.bat**  
   a batch that should be able to stop windows to exaust my laptop's battery with unwanted wakeups

2. **phone_list_subfolder.ps1**  
   a tiny powershell script that is able to list the whole content of a folder in the mobile MTP device manually *mounted* in Windows

3. **show-win-path.bat**  
   a tiny batch that is able to print windows PATH variable with one directory per line (all kudos to stacktrace users)

4. **fix-tag-in-mp3-files-with-pattern.py**  
   a python script that provides a simple way to change mp3 tags via cmd line (again: all kudos to stacktrace users)
