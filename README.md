various batches to help users live with windows

1. **force-laptop-sleep.bat**
   a batch that should be able to stop windows to exaust my laptop's battery with unwanted wakeups

2. **show-win-path.bat**
   a tiny batch that is able to print windows PATH variable with one directory per line (all kudos to stacktrace users)
